They start with a single question (\"Where was Barack Obama born\") and feed the Google Suggest API with three query fragments generated from the source question: the question without the phrase before the entity, the question without the entity and the question without the phrase after the entity. Each of these queries generates 5 candidate questions. The candidate questions are added to a queue of questions and the process is repeated for each of the questions in the queue. They stop after 1M questions are generated. Due to the nature of the approach, the generated questions start with a wh-word and revolve around a single entity. 100K of these questions are given to crowdsourcing workers who select a Freebase entity, value or list of entities as answer.
