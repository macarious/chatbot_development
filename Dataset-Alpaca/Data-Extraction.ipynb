In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the text-davinci-003 model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite.\n","\n","Alpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed. Importantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless. We thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.\n","\n","Our initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience."],"metadata":{"id":"2Dkx_9RwaFu8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import json\n","\n","def data_extraction(file_path: str) -> list:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Extracts relevant data from the JSON file and\n","    organized them into two columns: questions, answers.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","        file_path (str): file path name to the JSON file\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list_questions_answers (list): list of dictionaries\n","        with questions and answers\n","    \"\"\"\n","    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","        data = json.load(file)\n","\n","    list_questions_answers = []\n","\n","    for item in data:\n","        question = item['instruction']\n","        answers = item['output']\n","        if answers:\n","            question_answer = {\n","                'question': question,\n","                'answer': answers\n","            }\n","            list_questions_answers.append(question_answer)\n","\n","    print(f'Total number of questions: {len(list_questions_answers)}')\n","\n","    return list_questions_answers\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sAAhL6JTagIy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713882149835,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny Wang","userId":"13778647706412786346"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","\n","file_path = file_paths[0]\n","input_file = file_path['input_file']\n","output_file = file_path['output_file']\n","output_dir = 'output'\n","\n","print(f\"Processing {input_file}...\\n\")\n","list_questions_answers = data_extraction(input_file)\n","print(f\"Number of questions and answers in {input_file}: {len(list_questions_answers)}\\n\")\n","print(f\"First 5 entries:\\n\")\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(f\"Question {i+1}: {list_questions_answers[i]['question']}\")\n","    print(f\"Answer {i+1}: {list_questions_answers[i]['answer']}\\n\")\n","\n","if not os.path.exists(output_dir):\n","    os.makedirs(output_dir)\n","\n","output_file_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_file)\n","with open(output_file_path, 'w') as file:\n","    json.dump(list_questions_answers, file)\n","\n","print(f\"Data saved in {output_file_path}\\n\")\n","print(\"-\" * 20)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2DJuFjQrd7FV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713882150524,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":690,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny Wang","userId":"13778647706412786346"}},"outputId":"f5272afc-8c95-49ea-ffc5-a469ec97c66e"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Processing alpaca_data.json...\n","\n","Total number of questions: 51974\n","Number of questions and answers in alpaca_data.json: 51974\n","\n","First 5 entries:\n","\n","Question 1: Give three tips for staying healthy.\n","Answer 1: 1.Eat a balanced diet and make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables. \n","2.

The protons and neutrons have a positive charge, while the electrons have a negative charge, resulting in an overall neutral atom. The number of each particle determines the atomic number and the type of atom.\n","\n","Question 4: How can we reduce air pollution?\n","Answer 4: There are a number of ways to reduce air pollution, such as shifting to renewable energy sources, encouraging the use of public transportation, prohibiting the burning of fossil fuels, implementing policies to reduce emissions from industrial sources, and implementing vehicle emissions standards. Additionally, individuals can do their part to reduce air pollution by reducing car use, avoiding burning materials such as wood, and changing to energy efficient appliances.\n","\n","Question 5: Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\n","Answer 5: I had to make a difficult decision when I was working as a project manager at a construction company. I was in charge of a project that needed to be completed by a certain date in order to meet the client’s expectations. However, due to unexpected delays, we were not able to meet the deadline and so I had to make a difficult decision. I decided to extend the deadline, but I had to stretch the team’s resources even further and increase the budget. Although it was a risky decision, I ultimately decided to go ahead with it to ensure that the project was completed on time and that the client’s expectations were met. The project was eventually successfully completed and this was seen as a testament to my leadership and decision-making abilities.\n","\n","Data saved in output/alpaca_data_trained.json\n","\n","--------------------\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# zip the files and download\n","import shutil\n","from google.colab import files\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","file_name = 'dataset' + '_' + datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S\")\n","shutil.make_archive(file_name, 'zip', 'output')\n","files.download(file_name + '.zip')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"id":"m9fhmVvNe9vz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713882152007,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1485,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny Wang","userId":"13778647706412786346"}},"outputId":"8e71954b-5312-4d90-9e86-0d5c5773ae37"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["\n","    async function download(id, filename, size) {\n","      if (!google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed) {\n","        return;\n","      }\n","      const div = document.createElement('div');\n","      const label = document.createElement('label');\n","      label.textContent = `Downloading \"${filename}\": `;\n","      div.appendChild(label);\n","      const progress = document.createElement('progress');\n","      progress.max = size;\n","      div.appendChild(progress);\n","      document.body.appendChild(div);\n","\n","      const buffers = [];\n","      let downloaded = 0;\n","\n","      const channel = await google.colab.kernel.comms.open(id);\n","      // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","      channel.send({})\n","\n","      for await (const message of channel.messages) {\n","        // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","        channel.send({})\n","        if (message.buffers) {\n","          for (const buffer of message.buffers) {\n","            buffers.push(buffer);\n","            downloaded += buffer.byteLength;\n","            progress.value = downloaded;\n","          }\n","        }\n","      }\n","      const blob = new Blob(buffers, {type: 'application/binary'});\n","      const a = document.createElement('a');\n","      a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n","      a.download = filename;\n","      div.appendChild(a);\n","      a.click();\n","      div.remove();\n","    }\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["download(\"download_31e4774e-0737-48de-9eef-09c5c79c0470\", \"dataset_20240423-142230.zip\", 6530613)"]},"metadata":{}}]}]}
